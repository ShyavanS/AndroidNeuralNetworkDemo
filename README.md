# AndroidNeuralNetworkDemo
A demo or test program using Chaquopy to run a Python script in a Java app meant to run on Android. The app uses the sklearn diabetes dataset for generating and preforming functions with neural network models.

Similar to the other demo program of mine using Chaquopy, but instead of testing if the API works in the manner required by using a basic hill cipher program, this confirms it still works when using it for the purposes of a machine learning model as a proof of concept before attempting the actual project which is pertaining to water quality monitoring.
